      Abstract:
      An apparatus and method for brewing coffee of higher quality and better taste than any apparatus and method currently available, while also enabling users to utilize less coffee grounds per brewing cycle, thereby achieving significant cost savings for users. A basket that houses a packet of coffee grounds is housed within a chamber that stores water. The basket is fabricated so that water may enter therein and exit therefrom, and the packet of coffee grounds enables water and natural coffee oils to penetrate the packet, but does not allow coffee grounds to escape the packet. The water chamber is filled with water that is gradually heated from at or around tap temperature to approximately boiling. While the water in the chamber is heated, the basket is agitated. This causes the gradually heating water to enter the basket and agitate the packet, thereby extracting natural coffee oil from the grounds stored within the packet, which creates brewed coffee. The entire brewing process may be controlled by electronic controlling means.
